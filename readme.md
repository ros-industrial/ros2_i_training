1. This quick start will walk you through creating the basic configuration; in most cases, you can just accept the defaults. When it’s done, you’ll have an `index.rst`, a `conf.py` and some other files. 

2.  Now, edit your `index.rst` and add some information about your project. Include as much detail as you like 
3.  Build them to see how they look:
 ````bash
 make html
 ````
4.  Your `index.rst` has been built into `index.html` in your documentation output directory ` _build/html/index.html`
5.  Open this file in your web browser to see your docs.
